# Introduction to Git and Github

## Setup
Have patience. Setting up software tools can be frustrating, but you'll get trough it! 

Install git

Create a github account

## Introductions!


## What is Git?

- Why use version control


## What is Github?


## Git Started:

a few bash(terminal commands)

- `cd` change directory 
- `ls` List 
- `ls -a` List all (even hidden files)

- `git init`
- `git add .` 
- `git status`
- `git commit -m"Commit Message"`

You just made your first commit!

sometimes you don't want to add every file like the `git add .` command does. Instead you may want to only commit specific files. You can use `git add filename.file` command. replace "filename.file" with the actual name of your file. 

git commit messages


So what happened?
3 stages of git

- Modified (When we used `git status` and saw it red)
- staging (When we used `git status` and saw it green)
- commited 


lets make a small change to our file

- `git status`
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m"message"`

Lets see what commits we have made so far!

- `git log`

## Git out of here!
